# Changelog

## 1.0.7

### New Features

- **Primary key indicator**: Column headers now display a key icon for primary key columns, making it easy to identify primary keys at a glance.

### Improvements

- **Manual column filter**: Filters now require pressing Enter or clicking the search button to apply, instead of auto-filtering while typing. This provides better control and avoids unnecessary queries.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed column filter returning no results causing headers to disappear, leaving users stuck with no way to clear the filter. Now shows a "No rows match the current filter" message while keeping filter inputs accessible.

## 1.0.6

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed icons not showing

## 1.0.5

### New Features

- **Fully customizable column widths**: Columns can now be resized to any width (minimum 30px). Resize handle extends beyond cell border for easier grabbing on narrow columns.
- **Cell preview modal**: Click the expand icon on truncated cells to view and edit full content in a floating window. Includes JSON formatting, word wrap toggle, and character count.
- **Delete columns**: Select a column (click header selection icon) and press Delete button to remove the column and all its data.
- **Clear cell values (Cmd+Delete / Ctrl+Delete)**: Select cells and press Cmd+Delete (Mac) or Ctrl+Delete (Windows/Linux) to clear their values to NULL (or empty string for NOT NULL columns).

### Improvements

- Resize handle is now 10px wide with 4px extension beyond cell border for easier grabbing
- Column width minimum reduced from 60px to 30px for compact display
- Delete button now works for both row and column deletion
