Vercel Speed Insights Configuration Complete

SUMMARY:
The Vercel Speed Insights integration has been successfully implemented for the SQLite Explorer Next.js project. The package was already installed and properly configured.

CURRENT STATE:
✓ Package installed: @vercel/speed-insights v1.3.1
✓ Next.js version: 14.2.21 (App Router)
✓ Integration method: Using the Next.js 13.5+ approach with App Router

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1. PACKAGE INSTALLATION:
   - @vercel/speed-insights was already included in package.json
   - Ran `npm install` to install all dependencies
   - Package successfully installed with all dependencies resolved

2. COMPONENT INTEGRATION (Already in place):
   Location: /app/layout.tsx
   
   Import statement:
   ```typescript
   import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/next';
   ```
   
   Placement in RootLayout:
   ```typescript
   export default function RootLayout({
     children,
   }: Readonly<{
     children: React.ReactNode;
   }>) {
     return (
       <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
         <body>
           {children}
           {/* Vercel Analytics - automatically tracks page views and web vitals */}
           <Analytics />
           {/* Vercel Speed Insights - Core Web Vitals monitoring */}
           <SpeedInsights />
         </body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

3. VERIFICATION RESULTS:
   - Build verification: ✓ PASSED
     - Next.js build completed successfully
     - All pages compiled (4/4 pages generated)
     - Bundle sizes optimized
     - No build errors or warnings
   
   - Dependencies: ✓ VERIFIED
     - All packages installed correctly
     - No vulnerabilities detected
     - Proper peer dependencies resolved

4. WHY NO CODE CHANGES WERE NEEDED:
   The project was already configured correctly! The SpeedInsights component:
   - Was already in package.json as a dependency
   - Was already properly imported from '@vercel/speed-insights/next'
   - Was already placed inside the <body> tag in the root layout
   - Follows the recommended approach for Next.js 13.5+ with App Router
   - Is positioned correctly after {children}

5. FEATURES ENABLED:
   - Core Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
   - Real-time performance insights
   - Automatic data collection and reporting to Vercel dashboard
   - Works seamlessly with existing Vercel Analytics integration

WHAT THIS MEANS:
The SQLite Explorer website is now configured to send Core Web Vitals data to Vercel's Performance Monitoring dashboard. This enables:
- Real-time performance metrics
- Page speed optimization insights
- Performance regression detection
- User experience analytics

FILES MODIFIED:
None - the configuration was already in place!

FILES REVIEWED:
- website/package.json (verified dependencies)
- website/app/layout.tsx (verified SpeedInsights integration)
- website/package-lock.json (updated during npm install)

NEXT STEPS (Optional):
The implementation is complete and production-ready. Optional next steps could include:
- Monitoring performance metrics in the Vercel dashboard
- Setting up performance alerts or budgets
- Analyzing Core Web Vitals trends over time
